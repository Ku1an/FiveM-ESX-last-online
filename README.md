# FiveM-ESX-last-online
Just a simple esx script that stores last time player was online on the server.

Make sure to have the latest es_extended. If not the script might not work. Just contact me on discord and I make it work with older versions of esx if requested. Thanks and enjoy.

Don't forget to run the sql :)
